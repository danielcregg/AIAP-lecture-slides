# Lecture Scripts

This directory contains the generated narration scripts for each lecture. These scripts are automatically generated by the video generation workflow using Gemini AI, but can be manually edited to customize the narration.

## Script Format

Each lecture has a script file named `{lecture-name}_script.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "lecture_name": "lecture1-course-introduction",
  "generated_at": "2024-01-15 14:30:45",
  "total_slides": 25,
  "scripts": [
    {
      "slide": 1,
      "script": "Welcome to the AI-Assisted Programming course. Today we'll explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way we write code..."
    },
    {
      "slide": 2,
      "script": "Let's begin by understanding what AI-assisted programming really means..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **First Run**: When a new lecture PDF is processed, the workflow:
   - Uses Gemini AI to analyze each slide and generate narration scripts
   - Saves the scripts to a JSON file in this directory
   - Converts scripts to audio using MiniMax TTS API
   - Generates the final video

2. **Subsequent Runs**: If a script file already exists:
   - The workflow loads the existing scripts instead of generating new ones
   - This allows you to manually edit scripts without losing changes

## Editing Scripts

To customize the narration for any lecture:

1. Find the script file for your lecture (e.g., `lecture1-course-introduction_script.json`)
2. Edit the `script` field for any slide you want to modify
3. Save the file
4. Re-run the video generation workflow or trigger it manually

The workflow will use your edited scripts instead of generating new ones.

## Tips for Good Scripts

- Keep each slide's narration to 30-60 seconds when spoken
- Use conversational, academic tone suitable for university students
- Don't mention slide numbers or "this slide" - just present content naturally
- Build connections between concepts across slides
- Explain rather than just read bullet points

## Regenerating Scripts

To force regeneration of scripts (losing any manual edits):

1. Delete the script JSON file for the lecture
2. Re-run the video generation workflow

The workflow will generate fresh scripts from the PDF using Gemini AI.
