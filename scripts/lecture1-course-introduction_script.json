    {
      "slide": 4,
      "script": "Your first critical task is to enroll in this module on Moodle. Please follow the steps outlined on this slide carefully. You will need to navigate to the ATU Moodle page, search for the course, and then find your assigned group—A, B, or C. Use the corresponding password shown to complete your enrollment."
    },
    {
      "slide": 5,
      "script": "Let’s briefly review the structure of the course. The module runs for a total of 13 weeks, and we are currently in Week 1. Each week will consist of a one-hour lecture and a two-hour lab session per group. Please note, there are no lab sessions in this first week. For your specific times, please consult the official university timetable at timetables.atu.ie."
    },
    {
      "slide": 6,
      "script": "Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to identify and evaluate various AI coding tools. You will also be able to integrate these tools into a practical development workflow, critically analyze their benefits and limitations, and explore emerging trends in this rapidly advancing field."
    },
    {
      "slide": 7,
      "script": "The definitive guide for this course is the live syllabus, which you can find on the module's Moodle page. This document contains a detailed week-by-week breakdown of topics and will be updated regularly throughout the course. I encourage you to check it frequently to stay informed."
    },
    {
      "slide": 8,
      "script": "Your performance in this module will be evaluated through three assessments. There will be two multiple-choice quizzes, one in Week 7 and another in Week 12, each accounting for 30% of your final grade. The remaining 40% will be determined by a final project due in Week 13."
    },
    {
      "slide": 9,
      "script": "To provide more detail on assessments: the multiple-choice quizzes will be based on material from previous lectures and labs. For the final project, you will build an application in a language of your choice, but you must use and incorporate AI tools in its development. A detailed project brief will be provided later in the semester."
    },
    {
      "slide": 10,
      "script": "This is a five-credit module, which translates to an expected student effort of 100 to 125 hours over the 13 weeks. Please be aware that self-directed learning is a major component of this module. The practical skills are best developed through your own hands-on exploration and practice."
    },
    {
      "slide": 11,
      "script": "We will be using a suite of essential development and AI tools. Your core toolkit will include GitHub for repository storage, Codespaces for a cloud-based development environment, and of course, GitHub Copilot. These platforms will be our primary interface for working with various AI code assistants."
    },
    {
      "slide": 12,
      "script": "Before our next class, please complete these essential action items. You must sign up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free access to our tools. It is also important that you change your GitHub username to your actual name for grading purposes. Finally, ensure you are enrolled on Moodle and have reviewed the live syllabus."
    },
    {
      "slide": 13,
      "script": "Looking ahead, we will be diving directly into hands-on work. You can expect to gain practical experience with GitHub Copilot in our coding sessions, where we will move from foundational concepts to building real-world applications with AI assistance. Get ready to fundamentally change the way you write code."
    },
    {
      "slide": 14,
      "script": "I will now open the floor for any questions. Please feel free to ask about the course structure, assessment methods, required tools, or any technical issues with enrollment. And always remember the central philosophy of this course: this is about learning to work *with* AI, not being replaced by it."
    },
    {
      "slide": 15,
      "script": "Thank you for your time and attention. I am genuinely excited to embark on this journey with you and explore the cutting edge of software development. That concludes our introductory session. Our next lecture will provide a formal introduction to the core concepts of AI-assisted programming."
