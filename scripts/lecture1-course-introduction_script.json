      "slide": 10,
      "script": "Let's discuss the expected effort and expectations for this module. This is a 5-credit module, implying an estimated commitment of between 100 to 125 hours of study over its 13-week duration. It's crucial to understand that self-directed learning will be the primary source of knowledge acquisition in this module. Your active engagement outside of scheduled class times is essential for success."
    },
    {
      "slide": 11,
      "script": "To succeed in this module, you'll need access to several essential tools and resources. For development, we'll primarily use GitHub for repository storage, Codespaces for free virtual machines in the cloud, and GitHub Copilot, which is our core AI programming assistant. We'll also leverage various command-line interface tools. On the AI side, we'll explore code generation assistants, debugging companions, documentation generators, and advanced code completion tools."
