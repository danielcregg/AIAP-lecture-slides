Here are the narration scripts for each slide in the presentation, designed for a university lecture.\n\n***\n\n**Slide 1: AI-ASSISTED PROGRAMMING**\nWelcome everyone to our course on AI-Assisted Programming. In this first lecture, we will provide an introduction to what is arguably the future of software development. Over the next hour, we'll explore the foundational concepts and tools that are fundamentally reshaping how we write code.\n\n(pause)\n\n**Slide 2: LEARNING OBJECTIVES**\nBy the end of this lecture, you should be able to define AI-assisted programming, identify current tools, and analyze their impact on both productivity and code quality. We'll also examine adoption statistics and discuss the associated benefits and challenges, before looking ahead to the future.\n\n(pause)\n\n**Slide 3: WHAT IS AI-ASSISTED PROGRAMMING?**\nSo, what exactly is AI-assisted programming? At its core, it's the use of artificial intelligence tools to augment the development process. This includes ta...",
